      <h1>Welcome to Clark County Historical Museum Oral History Collection</h1>
      <p>This digital collection contains transcripts and sound recordings selected from over 200 interviews in the oral history collections of the Clark County Historical Museum (CCHM) in Vancouver, Washington. The oral history collection at CCHM contains interviews with a wide variety of individuals from as far back as the 1950’s. Interviews with POWs, railroad workers, business owners like George Propstra, rancher and historian Margaret Colf-Hepola and many others create a fascinating look at the history of Clark County. The digitization of these interviews was made possible through the generous funding of Clark County's Historical Promotions Grant.</p>

She became an active member of the Vancouver Branch of NAACP in 1944 while the local chapter was still being established and served 29 years as its president. As residents of war housing in the McLoughlin Heights area, Val and Joseph actively worked with the NAACP and the Vancouver Housing Authority (VHA) to integrate housing. Val’s stated mission for “elimination of racism in all of its forms wherever it exists” extended into her work for the Racial Justice Task Force, providing assistance for discriminated individual and offering training toward resolving of cultural differences. Val was also a longtime member of the YWCA and started a program with the organization in 1973 called WORTH, a volunteer effort offering life skills to inmates at the Clark County jail. Val obtained a Master’s in Education from Lewis and Clark College and taught at the Washington State School for the Deaf for 22 years. Her legacy is commemorated each year by the Vancouver YWCA through its Joshua Racial Justice Award and Val Joshua Youth Social Justice Award.</br><br>Click <a href="https://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/p16866coll4/search/searchterm/Val%20Joshua">here</a> to listen to a 1991 interview with Val Joshua.</p><p>photo: Valree Joshua (left) and Wilton Slocum at NAACP Gathering, 1970 (cchm 2007.1.2.24)</p>

	  <p>Emil Fries was born in Brewster, Washington in 1901. Born with impaired vision, Fries was a student at the Washington State School for the Blind (WSSB) in Vancouver, Washington where he learned piano tuning. After graduating in 1924, Fries attended the University of Washington and received his bachelor’s degree in 1930. In 1931, he returned to Vancouver and became a piano tuning instructor at WSSB until 1949. Fries established Emil Fries Piano Hospital and Training Center in Vancouver in 1949 after WSSB ended its vocational track program. Fries created the school as a determined effort to make piano tuning and repair a career option for the blind. Students attending the school were typically not from the local area and came from across the world. As a tribute to Fries dedication towards providing education and career opportunities for the blind, Washington State governor Booth Gardner proclaimed February 9, 1991, Emil Fries Appreciation Day.</p>
