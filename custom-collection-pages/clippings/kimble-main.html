The core of the database is the Northwest newspaper clippings collection. The newspaper articles were collected and organized in the late 1930's by dedicated historians working for the Works Progress Administration. The work was organized and supervised by Dr. Herman Deutsch, a professor at WSU.
    <br><br>
    The database also includes primary source material such as government reports, laws, maps, etc. pertaining to the settlement and development of the northwest. In addition the site has extensive links to other related web sites, such as Native American cultural sources, relevant dam web sites and important laws and legislation. The site is a work in progress and new material appear daily. If you find any bugs or glitches or if you would just like to send a suggestion, please e-mail the webmaster at <a href="mailto:mascref@wsu.edu">mascref@wsu.edu</a>. Funding for the creation and construction of this project was made in large part by the generous donations from WSU Alumni Wallis and Marilyn Kimble. In March, 2014, WSU Libraries Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections held an exhibit entitled "<a href="http://ntserver1.wsulibs.wsu.edu/masc/clippedhistory/index.html"><strong>Clipped History: The WPA and the Stories Behind the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Collection</strong></a>." Click on the exhibit title&nbsp;for photos and information on that exhibit. &nbsp;Thank you and enjoy your visit.&nbsp;
