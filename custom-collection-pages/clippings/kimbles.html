Under the supervision of Systems Librarian Ingrid Mifflin, 18,500 of 300,000+ articles from the Pacific NW Newspaper Clippings file were scanned, with indexing and description terms entered to make them searchable. A web index was designed and constructed with linking access added to related primary and secondary sources.

  The Kimbles were so pleased with the results of the digitizing project that they chose to extend funding to expand this extraordinary research tool. Their additional support not only continues the original vision but also allowed the project administrators to supervise the digitizing of the three volumes which make up the final engineering report of Frank A. Banks, principal engineer on the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. It is anticipated that other related materials will be digitized and linked to the clippings, so the project has been renamed to acknowledge the generosity of the donors and to reflect its expanded scope and will now be known as: The Wallis and Marilyn Kimble Northwest History Database.</p>
