      <h1>About the Vancouver Independent</h1>
	  <p>The Vancouver Independent was one of the first newspapers of the Washington Territory, covering news of Vancouver, Washington and the southern counties. It began publishing weekly in 1875. In its formative years, the Independent was distributed on Saturdays. In 1877 it changed its format from a four page paper to an eight page weekly delivered on Thursdays. The newspaper was established by William B. Daniels. Although the Independent aspired to be a politically neutral source, Daniels was active in the Republican Party. Daniels latter became mayor of Vancouver and then served in the state House of Representatives in 1898. Daniels sold the newspaper in 1878 to Thurston Daniels and John J. Beeson. The Independent ceased publication in 1910 under the ownership of Lloyd DuBois.</p>
