      <h1>Welcome to the Clark County Genealogical Society Digital Collections</h1>
      <p>The Clark County Genealogical Society Digital Collections is part of a partnership project between the Clark County Genealogical Society, Clark County Historical Museum and the WSU Vancouver Library. Current items in this collection consist of two Clark County tax ledgers originating from the City of Vancouver, dated 1886 and 1891. The 1886 ledger documents the names of residents prior to Washington statehood and is signed by E.A. Slocum, Vancouver City Assessor. The 1891 ledger lists additional taxes paid by residents for street, sewer and library. Both ledgers contain information on the location of residentsâ€™ property by lot and block and the value of property. The items in the collection include page images from the original documents as well as transcripts of the ledgers in Excel and PDF formats. Original ledgers were donated to the Clark County Genealogical Society and later transferred to the Southwest Washington Branch of the Washington State Archives. The digitization of these records were made possible through funding by Clark County's Historical Promotions Grant.</p>
