      <p>Does a particular photograph tell a story other than what is immediately visible to the viewer? Historians ask a number of questions in order to understand the deeper meaning of photographs. Images, they say, are versions of reality that photographers interpret for intended audiences. Photographers use images to convey messages to particular audiences. Photos reflect the perspective of photographers and must therefore be viewed with a critical eye. What images does a particular photo capture? What was the context of the time in which the photo was taken? What audience did the photographer have in mind and for what purpose? These are only a few examples of questions historians ask in interpreting the meaning of photographs. They are are historical documents, a valuable resource to help reconstruct the past. The Columbia River Basin Ethnic History Archive contains an extensive collection of photographs that document the experience of blacks in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Students, researchers, and others can use these photos to enhance their understanding of the history of African Americans in the Columbia River Basin.
