                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Mexicans have lived in the Pacific Northwest since the 1850s.
                They continued to come to the region for mining and ranching
                opportunities through the latter half of the nineteenth century. In
                the first two decades of the twentieth century, political and
                economic conditions in Mexico that resulted from revolution and the
                repressive policies of President Porfirio Diaz pushed many out of
                Mexico to go north. Agricultural and railroad expansion and labor
                shortages in the United States also pulled thousands of Mexicans
                from their homeland to the Southwest and to other regions of the
                United States. </P>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Mexican American communities in the Columbia River Basin began to
                grow dramatically beginning in the early 1940s. World War II
                agricultural labor shortages drew more Mexican Americans and Mexican
                immigrants to the region. By the1960s small enclaves of families who
                decided to settle out of the migrant stream dotted rural
                communities in southwestern Idaho, the Treasure Valley in Oregon and
                Idaho, Willamette Valley in Oregon, and the Yakima Valley in
                Washington. In the last three decades of the twentieth century, a
                new migration wave from Mexico brought thousands more to the region
                who joined their predecessors and helped create vibrant communities.
                Today Mexican Americans populate urban areas as well, as significant
                numbers have chosen to settle in Portland, Spokane, and Boise, and
                are counted among the 623,000 people of Mexican origin enumerated by
                the Census of 2000 in the states of Idaho, Oregon, and
                Washington.</P>
    <p>
                <P><h2>Early Migrants and Settlers: Miners, Packers and
                Vaqueros</h2></P>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Some of the earliest Mexican migrants in the Columbia River Basin
                were mule packers, miners, and vaqueros (cowboys). Mexican mule
                packers were the descendants of generations of Spanish-Mexicans who
                learned their trade in Mexico, the Southwest, and California and
                moved supplies of all types from distribution points in northern
                California to areas as far north as the Illinois Valley in Oregon.
                In the mid-1850s, Mexican packers also supplied the Second Regiment
                Oregon Mounted Volunteers during the Rogue River War in Oregon, and
                in the 1870s brought supplies to the mining camps in Idaho. Mexican
                miners worked the placers in the hills near Idaho City, and in the
                late 1870s Manuel Fontez discovered rich quartz veins in the Salmon
                River Mountains between the middle and south forks.<BR><BR>Like
                their mule-packer cultural siblings, Mexican vaqueros learned their
                trade centuries before in the ranchos of Spanish and Mexican
                California and Texas. They developed their skills in horsemanship
                and in the various tasks required to tend cattle herds. They brought
                their talents to Idaho and Oregon in the early 1870s and trained
                young Anglos aspiring to become cowboys. In 1872 rancher John Devine
                hired Mexican vaqueros to trail his herd to Oregon from California.
                Several of these men who worked with Devine until the turn of the
                century became some of the earliest Mexican American settlers in the
                Pacific Northwest. Vaqueros from Texas and from California also
                distinguished themselves in Idaho as they did in Oregon. Felipe
                Carruso and his California vaqueros managed thousands of cattle for
                Dan Murphy in Owyhee County. Joseph Amera acquired land and stock of
                his own and raised thousands of cattle near White Bird, and
                Guadalupe Valdez worked cattle in south central Idaho.</p>
               <p><h2>Railroad and Migrant Workers</h2></P>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">The story of Mexican Americans in the Pacific Northwest in the
                twentieth century is closely related to the development of the
                railroads and irrigated agriculture. Revolution and the resulting
                chaotic economic conditions in Mexico caused hundreds of thousands
                of Mexicans to enter the United States in the years from 1917 to the
                outbreak of the Great Depression in1929. The expansion of sugar beet
                production in Idaho pulled Mexican migrants to the Columbia River
                Basin. As demand for labor increased, recruiters for the railroad
                companies and agriculture fanned out to the southwestern states and
                border cities in northern Mexico and enlisted many Mexicans eager to
                find work and a better life in the United States. </P>
            
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Some migrants hired out with the railroad companies in the
                Southwest and Midwest working in el traque (railroad section
                gangs) and ended up in Idaho. Rita Perez's parents came to Idaho
                Falls in 1925. In an oral history <A
                href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/1528/rec/2">interview</A>
                Perez recalls that her father worked for the railroad and traveled
                a lot before deciding to settle in Idaho Falls. Other Mexicans came
                to Oregon to work with the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company,
                the Union Pacific Railroad, and the Oregon Short Line in the years
                before World War I. </P><BR>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Thousands of migrant workers from Mexico and the
                Southwest also came to the Columbia River Basin in response to
                aggressive recruitment of sugar companies and farmers. Others made
                it to Idaho, Oregon, and Washington on their own as word of work
                opportunities traveled through kinship networks. Juanita Huerta's
                parents migrated from the Mexican state of Zacatecas to Shelby,
                Idaho in 1918, where she was born the same year. <A
                href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/1520/rec/2">Thomas
                Murillo's</A> parents crossed the border at El Paso and boarded a
                train of the Utah and Idaho Sugar Company to Blackfoot, Idaho, to
                work in the beet fields. Sally De La Garza's parents first migrated
                to Montana in the early 1900s, where her father worked for a sugar
                company and as a laborer for the railroad. Her family moved to Idaho
                in 1932 and settled near Idaho Falls to work on farms. The Great
                Depression dramatically slowed Mexican migration to the region but
                did not stop it completely.</p>

                advent of World War II, and the demand for labor increased again.
                Recruiters sought Mexicans and Mexican Americans in northern Mexico
                and the Southwest, who responded by the thousands and came to toil
                in the fields and orchards of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. This
                time the <A

                government</A> also joined the effort by entering into an agreement
                with Mexico to import Mexican contract workers, who became known as
                braceros, to harvest the crops in the Pacific Northwest and other
                regions of the <A
                href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1649/rec/1">country</A>.
                Mexican Americans continued to migrate to the region. For example,
                <A
                href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/1522/rec/2">Antonio
                Rodriguez</A> came with his family to Aberdeen, Idaho in 1941 from
                their home in Karnes City, Texas. They settled in Nampa in 1954.</p>
              
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Not all Mexicans or Mexican Americans migrated
                directly to the Columbia River Basin. Victoria Sierra's family, who
                settled in Pocatello, Idaho in 1942, first moved to Grand Junction
                from their home in La Junta, Colorado. The family then moved to
                Nyssa, Oregon before settling in Pocatello. Abel Vasquez's family
                first moved to Salt Lake City before migrating to Preston, Idaho.</p>

                attract Mexicans and Mexican Americans to Oregon, Idaho, and
                Washington. In Oregon Mexicans and Mexican Americans from California
                and Texas worked the crops in the Rogue River, the Willamette, Hood
                River, and the Treasure Valleys. In central Washington Mexicans and
                Mexican Americans concentrated in the Yakima Valley but also worked
                in the Wenatchee Valley and the Pasco and Walla Walla areas. In
                western Washington they worked as far north as the Mt. Vernon area

                southwestern parts of Idaho, including the Treasure Valley.
                Depending on the location these itinerant workers thinned sugar
                beets, topped onions, harvested hops and green beans, and picked
                potatoes, apples, asparagus and cherries. As early as the mid-1940s
                many Mexican American migrant workers began "settling out" of the
                migrant stream to seek year-round employment and to establish
                permanent roots in the areas where they worked. As new food
                processing plants provided jobs and as more of their children
                received an education, Mexican Americans were able to establish
                communities. </p>

                legacy of agricultural expansion and of the cultural and religious
                traditions of Mexican Americans. The Mexican settlers of the 1920s
                and 1930s were few in number and lived in considerable isolation
                from their ethnic counterparts in the Southwest. However, as their
                numbers increased in the 1940s and 1950s their cultural and
                religious celebrations fostered ethnic solidarity.</P>

                people of Mexican origin. Escuelitas (little schools), community
                cultural centers, artists, and dance and theater groups sprouted to
                give direction to the cultural renaissance. La Escuelita was
                founded in Granger, Washington in 1969, and the same year in
                Oregon's Willamette Valley, Centro Chicano Cultural was organized
                near Woodburn. In 1972 in Caldwell, Idaho, Mexican American families
                organized FAMA (Familias Mexico Americanas) to promote the
                preservation of Mexican American culture. These groups stressed the
                need to preserve the Spanish language, to study Mexican history, and
                to present Mexican and Mexican American cultural traditions. In
                turn, theater groups such as El Teatro del Piojo (theater of lice)
                sought to promote awareness of social issues affecting Mexican
                Americans in the Pacific Northwest.</P>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Religion-based celebrations and customs also fostered ethnic
                solidarity and the continuity of Mexican culture among Mexican
                American communities in the Pacific Northwest. Compadrazgo
                (co-parenthood), which centered on baptism of Mexican and Mexican
                American children, bonded families together. For Mexican American
                girls an important event was the Quinceanera, an event that
                signifies the passage of a girl to womanhood and is celebrated when
                Mexican American girls reach their fifteenth birthday. Other common
                religion-based celebrations are Las Posadas and the anniversary of
                the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe to the Indian Juan Diego.
                Las Posadas represent the re-creation of Mary and Joseph's search
                for lodging. Like the Mexican fiestas, these religion-based
                celebrations have fostered cultural continuity and reinforced
                Mexican American identity in the Columbia River Basin.</P>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Volunteer, cultural, and political associations also played a
                very important role in the formation of Mexican American communities
                in the Columbia River Basin. In 1955, Nampa World War II veteran
                Tony Rodriguez founded a local chapter of the American G. I. Forum,
                an advocacy organization for Mexican American veterans. In Nyssa,
                Oregon, Christina De La Cruz Vendrell helped establish Siempre
                Adelante (Always Forward), an organization that emerged in 1954 as a
                Mexican American community effort to seek justice in the hit- and-
                run death of a young Mexican American killed by a drunk Anglo
                driver. In 1967 the Mexican American Federation was organized in
                Yakima, Washington, to advocate for community development and
                political empowerment for Mexican Americans in the Yakima Valley. La
                Sociedad Mutualista, founded in Granger, Washington in 1968, focused
                on self-help for its members and sponsorship of social and cultural
                events. In 1968 Woodburn residents created the Latin American Club
                to promote preservation of Mexican American culture and awareness of
                social issues. </P>

                Mexican Americans in the region have been advocates for farm
                workers. The <A href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_2/id/278/rec/1">United
                Farm Workers Union</A>, based in Sunnyside, Washington in the Yakima
                Valley, has tried to organize and represent farm workers. PCUN
                (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), based in Woodburn, is
                the labor union advocate for Latino farm workers in Oregon. In
                Idaho, a labor union for Latino farm workers has not emerged.
                However, the Idaho Migrant Council, a non-profit organization, has
                advocated for Mexican American farm workers since the early 1970s.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Until the 1960s, most Mexicans and Mexican Americans
                in the Columbia River Basin were migrant farm workers. The
                transition to permanent residency and the civil rights movement
                changed this status for many, and more Mexican Americans have
                received a college education and have joined the ranks of
                professionals as educators, bankers, insurance and real estate
                agents, lawyers, doctors, journalists, and engineers. The vitality
                of Mexican American communities can also be seen in the explosion of
                numerous businesses such as taquerias (fast food eateries), <A
                href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_2/id/50/rec/1">restaurants</A>,
                bakeries and tortillerias (tortilla factories), and tienditas (small
                grocery stores that stock Mexican and other Latino ethnic foods)
                that dot the region's landscape. Mexican American entrepreneurial
                achievement is also represented in the abundance of businesses in
                lawn care and landscape services and auto repair shops throughout
                the region. Perhaps a more powerful indicator of the social and
                economic impact of the Mexican American presence in the Pacific
                Northwest is the proliferation of numerous Spanish-language
                newspapers, radio stations, and television programs that cater to
                Spanish-speaking audiences throughout the region. </p>

                River Basin are still in process of formation as new immigrants
                continue to come to the region. Since 1970 record numbers of
                Mexicans have entered the United States, and many of these have
                entered without legal documentation. They have joined Mexican
                Americans in established communities such as Sunnyside in
                Washington's Yakima Valley, Woodburn in the Willamette Valley of
                Oregon, and Caldwell in western Idaho, and constitute the majority
                in some small rural communities such as Wapato, Washington. They are
                also settling in urban and remote, isolated areas previously
                unpopulated by Mexicans or Mexican Americans. Prior to 1970, a small
                population, low levels of education, and discrimination kept Mexican
                Americans from any meaningful political participation in the
                communities where they resided. Mexican Americans and Mexicans will
                continue to shape politics and culture in the Columbia River Basin
                as more of them become U.S. citizens and more second-generation
                descendants obtain an education, vote, develop businesses, and
                contribute to the cultural life of the region.</P>
