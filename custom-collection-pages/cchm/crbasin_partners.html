Today, the OHS complex is a landmark in the heart of Portland's Cultural District and offers Oregon&#39;s rich multicultural history through museum exhibitions, research collections, and publications. The research library holdings are particularly strong in historical photograph and motion picture collections, archives of business firms and political and social organizations, oral history, and maps. OHS is also the institutional home of the state&#39;s Folklife Program that for over ten years has been documenting through tape-recorded interviews and photography the cultural traditions and folklife of many ethnic communities.
