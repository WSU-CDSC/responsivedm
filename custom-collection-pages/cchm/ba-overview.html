      <h2 style="padding-bottom: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; margin: 12px;"><strong><a name="intr"></a>Introduction</strong></h2>
	  
      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Basques first arrived 
        in the Americas with the Columbus expedition. They played prominent roles 
        in the formation of the Spanish colonies in the New World as merchants 
        and colonial officials. In the 1840s many Basque immigrants left their 
        homeland and settled in Argentina and Paraguay where they became hotel 
        owners and established themselves in sheep herding and tending livestock. 
        In 1850 Basque immigrants left Argentina bound for San Francisco as news 
        of gold strikes in California reached South America. Basques in California 
        soon discovered that competition from hundreds of miners of different 
        nationalities and anti-foreigner sentiment of American miners limited 
        their chances for striking it rich. By the 1860s, Basques began to find 
        work herding sheep and cattle, and with a few decades they dominated this 
        work in southern California and the San Joaquin Valley. Expansion of the 
        sheep and cattle industries coincided with the growth of mining centers, 
        and the Basque herders soon followed the trek of miners from California 
        to northeastern Nevada, southeastern Oregon, and southwestern Idaho. </p>

    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">The 
      identity of the first Basques to enter and settle in the Columbia River 
      Basin is difficult to establish. There are reports, however, of Basque pioneers 
      in Idaho in the 1880s and the 1890s. Jesus 
      Urquides ran a highly successful mule-packing operation in central and 
      southwestern Idaho during this time. In late spring 1889, Jose Navarro and 
      Antonio Azcuenaga, from the province of Bizkaia in the Basque country, reached 
      the present town of Jordan Valley in southeastern Oregon after surviving 
      a near-death experience in the desert. Many Basques followed Navarro and 
      Azcuenaga to Oregon and Idaho, as word reached the Great Basin and the Basque 
      homeland that there were opportunities for work in sheep herding. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Basque immigration 
        had a direct link to economic, political, and cultural conditions in the 
        Basque country, as well as to the growth of the sheep industry in the 
        Pacific Northwest. The mountainous terrain in the Basque Provinces limited 
        agricultural and farming potential, and Basque inheritance customs usually 
        favored the eldest male, encouraging other children to seek a livelihood 
        elsewhere. Many young Basque men were drawn to <font size="2">southwestern 
        Idaho and southeastern Oregon.</p>
      
	  <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">The sheep industry 
        in Idaho expanded considerably during the last two decades of the nineteenth 
        century. The industry had difficulty finding sheepherders who could withstand 
        the demanding and lonely nature of the work, and the industry soon turned 
        to Basque immigrants. Early settlers Juan Achabal and Jose Bengoechea, 
        who were among the first of their countrymen to prosper in the sheep industry 
        in the Columbia River Basin, facilitated the immigration of relatives 
        and friends, who soon joined them to try their fortunes herding sheep. 
        </p>
		
      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Basque immigration 
        to the region peaked in the years between 1900 and 1920. Most Basque immigrants 
        who came to Idaho and Oregon were from the Spanish province of Bizkaia. 
        Most were men who were either single or married and came without their 
        families. Some women joined husbands to work in agriculture, and some 
        families and single women came to towns and cities to run boarding houses 
        and other businesses for the Basque immigrant population. Most came with 
        the intention of staying in the United States just long enough to earn 
        and save enough money to return to the Basque country and buy a business 
        or a farm and live with their families. For many, however, the dream of 
        striking it rich in the promised land never came true. Many never earned 
        or accumulated enough money to return to their homeland and live the comfortable 
        lives they had planned.</p>

      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Basque sheepherders 
        earned thirty dollars a month plus room and board. This was substantially 
        more than their potential wages in the Basque country, but they paid a 
        high personal cost to earn these wages. Each herder had the responsibility 
        of caring for several hundred sheep, with only a dog to help him. There 
        were considerable risks involved. The herder had to account for lost sheep 
        to his employer, a responsibility made especially difficult due to the 
        threat of predators and hostile cattle ranchers. But perhaps the worst 
        aspect of the Basque sheepherder&#8217;s work was loneliness. The herding 
        cycle required him to be alone for long periods of time. In many cases herders 
        often went months without seeing or speaking to another human being and 
        had &#8220;only the sky and the dog to talk to.&#8221; Their limited English 
        skills also curtailed their contact with others. There are accounts of 
        Basque sheepherders who were overcome by loneliness and never regained 
        their mental health.</p>

 <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Many 
        Basque sheepherders moved to other types of work as soon as they could, 
        due to the demanding conditions of herding. They found work as farm 
        laborers, and in lumber mills and mines. Others found jobs in the 
        city or started their own businesses, such as boarding houses. Some enterprising 
        Basques started their own herds, and some became prominent in the sheep 
        industry. Juan Achabal, Jose Navarro, Jose Bengoechea, and others, were 
        very successful and soon had their own ranches in southern Idaho and in 
        Jordan Valley in southeastern Oregon. By 1920, John Archabal (previously 
        Juan Achabal) was one of the wealthiest men in Idaho and owned one of 
        the largest herds in the sheep industry. </p>

        emerged to cater to the needs of sheepherders for family and community. 
        Beginning in the 1890s Basque families rented out spare rooms to newly 
        arrived immigrants from the Basque homeland. Juan and Teresa <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/cdm-imls_2/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/imls_3&CISOPTR=459&CISOBOX=1&REC=1">Yribar</a> 
        opened one of the first Basque boarding houses at 118 South Seventh Street 
        in Boise in 1900, and Jose Uberuaga opened the City Lodge, also in Boise, 
        the following year. In 1910 the Boise city directory listed six Basque 
        boarding houses. By 1925, Basque boarding houses could be found in Nampa, 
        Hailey, Burns, Shoshone, Gooding, Twin Falls, Mountain Home, and north 
        to Mullen in Idaho, and to Jordan Valley and Ontario in southeastern Oregon.

      a social center for the Basque immigrant community. The herding cycle brought 
      herders down from the mountain grazing zones to the valleys during the winter. 
      The boarding houses filled with herders starved for the company of others 
      who spoke the same language and shared the same customs. They slept indoors 
      on real beds and enjoyed traditional Basque cuisine with other boarders 
      and the owners, all in a family atmosphere. </p>

      Basque boarding houses had a bar and pool tables, and were lively places where impromptu dances and parties were 
      held. Many boarding houses, which often recruited young women employees 
      from the Basque homeland, became places where many sheepherders met and 
      married their future wives.</p>

	  <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Basque boarding houses also served as support centers for immigrants, who often 
      arrived in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon with little money. Boarding 
      houses were the first point of contact, a temporary residence, for new arrivals 
      until they found employment. Proprietors often extended credit for room, 
      board, work clothing and equipment to these new arrivals. Boarding houses 
      also often served the role of hospitals; they were places where ill or injured 
      sheepherders could stay, on credit if necessary, until they recovered fully. 
      Doctors commonly made calls to boarding houses to treat their patients. 
      In addition, reports indicate that more babies were born in JuanYribar&#8217;s 
      boarding house, which he operated from 1900 to 1935, than any other place 
      in Boise except St. Luke&#8217;s Hospital. </p>

        houses in the Columbia River Basin also reinforced Basque cultural continuity 
        and social customs, such as the game pelota. 
        Pelota is a form of handball that is played in a court called a fronton. 
        Domingo Zabala built the first fronton in Boise in 1910. &quot;Big Jack&quot; 
        Anduiza built an indoor fronton in 1915 that was reputed to be the best 
        in the United States. By 1920 several other boarding houses in Boise, 
        Mountain Home, and other southwestern Idaho towns had built frontons. 
        In Oregon, a fronton was built in Jordan Valley. Several of the Basque 
        boarding houses in Boise, southwestern Idaho, and in Jordan Valley sponsored 
        pelota teams and games. A spirit of competition developed between boarding 
        houses that helped reinforce Basque connections and traditions.</p>

      1900 to 1920, many Basque immigrants married and formed families, and gave 
      up the goal of returning to their homeland. Second generation Basques 
      were raised in a bilingual, bicultural environment speaking the Basque language 
      Euskera at home, and English at school. Many children lost the Basque language, 
      and consequently Basque cultural traditions also suffered. Second generation 
      Basques began to identify themselves as Basque Americans.
	  Basque 
      immigration to the Columbia River Basin virtually ceased under the impact 
      of the Immigration quota law of 1922. By the outbreak of World War II, the 
      sheep industry in Idaho and Nevada raised concerns about the shortage of 
      Basque sheepherders. Political pressure by the sheep industry in the 1940s 
      and 1950s resulted in the &#8220;sheepherder laws,&#8221; which allowed 
      recruitment and importation of a new wave of Basque immigrants to work as 
      sheepherders in Idaho and other states in the West. This 
      new generation of Basque immigrants did not speak English and faced problems 
      similar to those experienced by their countrymen who had preceded them. 
      These new Basque immigrants, however, arrived in Idaho and the West at a 
      time when the Basque American community was well established. Basque American volunteer 
      associations were available to provide assistance when needed. The new 
      arrivals found life as sheepherders much more bearable. Transistor radios 
      were available to keep them in touch with the outside world and allowed 
      them to listen to radio programs, music, and information from the Basque 
      country.</p>

      arrival of this new generation of Basque immigrants reinvigorated Basque 
      traditions in the Columbia River Basin. Third generation Basque Americans 
      and some elders began to take interest in the preservation of Basque culture 
      and customs. In 1929, John Archabal started the Sheepherders Ball, an annual 
      event that went on to become an established tradition among Basque Americans 
      in Idaho. Basque Americans also began holding a picnic
      in late July of each year to celebrate the anniversary of St. Ignatius Loyola. 
      During the annual picnic, Basques gathered to eat traditional food such 
      as chorizos, to play baseball, and to socialize with their ethnic kin. </p>

      early 1948, Juanita &#8220;Jay&#8221; Hormaechea decided that young Basque 
      American children needed to learn Basque cultural traditions. She started 
      dance classes for children in Boise because she thought these traditions 
      were too important to lose. In 1960 a group of third generation Basque Americans 
      from Boise visited the Basque country where they became acquainted with 
      a dance group called Oinkari that taught them traditional Basque dances. 
      They returned to Idaho determined to start their own dance group and created 
      the Oinkari Basque Dancers of Boise in the early 1960s. By 1964 the Oinkari 
      Basque Dancers, well known by then in Idaho and other states, represented 
      Idaho at the World's 
      Fair in New York.</a> In 1963, Joe Eiguren began offering classes in Euskera 
      in an effort to revive the Basque language. His students included preschool

      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;"> 
	  Second and third 
        generation Basque Americans did not follow their ancestors&#8217; footsteps 
        as sheepherders. They had advantages that their fathers and grandfathers 
        did not have such as education and the ability to speak English. They 
        entered professions and businesses alongside other Americans. Some, like 
        Idaho Secretary of State Pete Cenarrusa, had successful careers as elected 
        officials. Basque Americans have made a substantial contribution to social 
        and economic life in the Columbia River Basin since the first Basque pioneers 
        arrived in Oregon and Idaho in the 1880s. They earned the acceptance of 
        the larger community because they were industrious and law-abiding citizens, 
        and because their work ethic and frugality coincided with the values of 
        the host society. They were able to focus more freely on social advancement 
        because they did not experience discrimination to the same degree as some 
        other immigrant groups. Like other ethnic groups, Basque Americans continue 
        to cultivate and adapt their traditions as they leave their imprint on 
        Columbia River Basin society.
