    <h1 style="padding-bottom: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; margin: 12px;">German American Background</h1> 
      <p>German immigrants first settled in the United States in the seventeenth
        century. Germany contributed over 6.9 million immigrants to the United
        States in the period between 1820 and 1970, accounting for fifteen percent
        of total immigration during this time. This has made German Americans
        one of the most significant ethnic groups in American society. </p>
      <p>Most German immigrants who came to the United States in the nineteenth
        century were from southwestern Germany. They came chiefly for economic
        reasons. For many German immigrants cultural and religious conflict were
        additional factors that made migration to a distant land a viable alternative.
        After 1870 significant numbers emigrated from the Volga River region of
        Russia, the descendants of migrants from southwestern Germany who were
        lured to Russia in the eighteenth century by the colonization program
        of Catherine II. In the early 1870s Russia instituted policies of forced
        assimilation and mandatory military service specifically aimed at the
        Volga Germans. Poor economic conditions and a shrinking land base were
        additional factors that prompted many Volga Germans, or German Russians,
        to immigrate to the United States. </p>
      <h3>Migration to the Columbia River Basin</h3>
      <p>Most German immigrants settled in New York and in the midwestern states
        of Wisconsin, Ohio, and Missouri; others ventured south into Texas. The
        Volga Germans took up farms in Nebraska and Kansas, but unfavorable climate
        and farming conditions caused them to look west for better farming opportunities.
        They became some of the earliest German American settlers in the Pacific
        Northwest. Their numbers increased substantially starting in the early
        1880s when they and other German Russians, mainly from the Black Sea region,
        were lured to the Pacific Northwest by the aggressive recruitment of the
        railroad companies. Companies such as the Northern Pacific needed unskilled
        labor and wanted to sell their lands and develop the region. They hired
        agents in the East, Midwest, and in Europe, and promoted the region extensively
        in newspapers, distributed thousands of circulars extolling the economic
        potential of the Pacific Northwest, and offered discounted fares and employment
        to lure immigrants to the area. In the 1880s agents of Henry Villard&#8217;s
        Northern Pacific Railroad recruited many Germans in Europe. </p></td>

      <p>Historically, German Americans have been an influential group in American
        society and in the Columbia River Basin. This influence is especially
        evident in economic life. Germans who arrived in the United States prior
        to 1870 migrated in family groups and had capital to buy land. The Volga
        and Black Sea Germans who came after 1880 were cash poor but were experienced
        farmers and industrious, hard-working people, which helped them succeed
        in agricultural production. Other Germans were represented in a wide variety
        of occupations in the Columbia River Basin. They were carpenters, bakers,
        saloonkeepers, brewers, merchants and professionals. Prominent German
        Americans who distinguished themselves as entrepreneurs included Henry
        Villard, who built a transportation empire constructing railroads and
        selling land in eastern Washington; John Lemp, a banker, brewer, and mayor
        of Boise; and Henry Thiele, who built a highly successful catering and
        restaurant business in Portland. </p></td>

    <td><h3>Social Life and Culture</h3>
      <p>Like other ethnic groups, German Americans have been characterized by
        great diversity in religion, politics, and voluntary associations. In
        the mid-nineteenth century Germans formed the Aurora Colony, a utopian
        religious community in the Willamette Valley. German Americans formed
        volunteer associations such the Turnverein in Boise and the General German
        Aid Society in Portland. Women&#8217;s associations such as the German
        Ladies Relief Society of Portland were also active. The Turnverein, an
        institution originally founded in Germany, focused on the overall physical
        and mental development of its members through gymnastics and physical
        exercise. The German Ladies Relief Society and General German Aid Society
        emphasized benevolent and relief activities in the German American community.
        U.S. involvement in WWI made German Americans targets of anti-German sentiments
        and suspicion. In the Columbia River Basin German Americans exhibited
        genuine patriotism but some were singled out as &#8220;unpatriotic&#8221;
        for speaking German . During
        World War II, some German Americans were openly pro-Germany and thus were
        under surveillance by the authorities.</p></td>

    <td><h3>German Ethnic Identity</h3>
      <p>Religion and culture have been central to German ethnic identity. Most
        Germans were Catholics and Lutherans, but many others were Jewish or members
        of other Protestant churches such as Methodists, Unitarians, or Evangelical.
        Religion was a strong factor in nourishing German ethnic identity. Celebrations
        such as the wedding dance and the feast at the home of the deceased after
        a funeral signified family milestones. Festivals celebrating the anniversary
        of a church dedication or patron saints affirmed communal values, while
        the German Christmas, with the traditional exchange of gifts, (Link: IHSH
        Ida Mielke Newman interview OH 0263) reinforced the bonds of close-knit
        families.<br>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><div align="left">
        <p>The German language was also an important factor in sustaining German
          ethnicity. In the Palouse countryside of eastern Washington, German
          Americans brought teachers from Germany to teach the language to the
          young and, specifically, to teach them to edit German-language newspapers.
          Although some congregations began holding services in English under
          the pressure of the World War I anti-German environment, many congregations
          in the region held services in German until the 1940s.</p>
        <p>During World War II, German Americans were once again under pressure
          to assimilate. In the latter half of the twentieth century most German
          Americans did not self-identify as Germans but as Americans. Since the
          1960s most signs of German ethnicity have disappeared from the Coloumbia
          River Basin landscape. However, this does not diminish the German American
          influence and contributions to development of the region's economy,
          society and culture. </p>
