Funded by a grant from the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute for Museum and Library Services</a>(2002-2004), the collaborative project sought to create a database with thematic coherence that would engage online researchers in thinking more deeply about the significance of the rich primary resources available in museums, libraries, and historical societies. We also hoped the project would serve as a model for other institutions that wanted to share collections and stimulate public interest in and use of those collections.</p>
      <p>The 1,200-mile long Columbia River drains a 259,000-square-mile basin that includes territory in seven states (Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, and Utah) and one Canadian province <a href=/customizations/collection/cchm/pages/img/crbasin_map.jpg" alt="Map of Columbia River Basin Region">(view map)</a>. The Columbia River Basin hosts the five institutions involved in this project and a variety of people who have migrated to this part of the Pacific Northwest over the past two hundred years.</p>
