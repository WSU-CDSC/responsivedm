    <h2 style="padding-bottom: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; margin: 12px;"><strong><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</strong></p></h2>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Small numbers of Chinese immigrants first entered the United States in
        the late 1840s. Most of these early immigrants, primarily from the Canton
        area, came to San Francisco to establish small businesses of various types.
        Soon after gold was discovered at Sutter&#8217;s Mill, the exciting news
        of potential wealth reached China, and by the early 1850s many more Chinese
        had immigrated to San Francisco.<br>
        <br>
        Gold strikes in Oregon and Washington in the mid-1850s, and in Idaho in
        the early 1860s, prompted many Chinese immigrants in California to follow
        other fortune seekers to the Columbia River Basin in search of economic
        opportunity. Many Chinese immigrants worked the placer mines but others
        provided various services to the mining camp population and towns as cooks,
        laundry workers, and store vendors. </p>

    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Chinese immigrants were present in large numbers in Washington
      Territory, which then included what later became Idaho, by the 1860s. Most
      Chinese <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/66/rec/1">miners</a>
      were concentrated in the upper Columbia, in the regions of Walla Walla,
      Fort Colville, and the Chelan and Methow Rivers. In the mid-1860s, they
      established one of the largest enclaves in the region in Chelan Falls. The
      village included the best-stocked store in the area, which was operated
      by a Chinese merchant who also owned a pack of forty animals. By 1870 Idaho
      had more than 4,000 Chinese, representing almost 30 percent of the total
      population in the Territory. In Washington Territory east of the Cascades,
      Chinese outnumbered whites by a ratio of two to one among the mining population
      . And by 1880, Walla Walla had a Chinese population of six hundred.<br> <br> <br>

    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Chinese immigrants found some measure of community in the &#8220;Chinatowns&#8221;
      of the Columbia River Basin. <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/search/collection/5985!cchm!wsuvan1!imls_2!imls_3!cvoralhist!methhist/searchterm/chinatown/field/all/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1">Chinatowns</a>
      offered immigrants a place where they could be at home with their countrymen
      and live according to their cultural traditions and values. Chinatowns usually
      included restaurants, opium &#8220;<a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/search/collection/5985!cchm!wsuvan1!imls_2!imls_3!cvoralhist!methhist/searchterm/opium/field/all/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1">dens</a>,&#8221;
      laundries, stores, and a Joss House where the Chinese could worship. For
      example, Silver City, Idaho, with a Chinese population of seven hundred
      in 1874, had a Chinese Masonic temple, two Joss houses, several restaurants,
      two laundries, four stores, two lotteries, five gambling houses, and several
      warehouses. Chinatowns were dynamic places that hosted cultural and religious
      celebrations and festivals. These included the celebration honoring the
      birth of the Goddess Quon Yum Po Sart, which began at sundown with a procession
      through the streets, and the Moon Festival held in August during full moon
      to appease the evil spirits. The most important celebration, the <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/64/rec/1">Chinese
      New Year</a>, was held before the first full moon in February. In 1873,
      celebrants in Idaho City ushered in the New Year with a barrage of firecrackers.
      The celebration included a parade with people marching through the streets
      with cymbals, gongs, and drums, and a brightly colored, writhing paper dragon
      with a ten-foot silk tail. Just as important, the Chinese New Year symbolized
      a time when the Chinese repented for spiritual sins, visiting the Joss house
      more frequently.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">In the 1870s, railroad construction also began to lure many Chinese immigrants
      to the region. By 1870 four rail lines under construction in Oregon employed
      several hundred Chinese laborers, all brought under contract from California
      and China. In April 1868 the Central Oregon Railroad had a Chinese crew
      on hand and projected hiring 1,000 additional Chinese laborers. Chinese
      laborers were contracted to work in the construction of the Walla Walla
      to Wallula <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1116/rec/1">railroad</a>
      from 1871 to 1875. The Northern Pacific also relied on Chinese contract
      laborers to construct its Kalama to Tacoma line. </td>


    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">In addition to mining and railroad work, many Chinese immigrants
      found opportunities in enterprises that served those industries, as merchants,
      restaurateurs, labor contractors, <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1184/rec/1">laundry</a>
      workers, and doctors. When Goon Dip came to the Pacific Northwest, he worked
      as a laborer and as a domestic servant. He rose to prominence as a labor
      contractor supplying Chinese workers to railroad and <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1158/rec/1">salmon
      companies</a> in Oregon, Washington and Alaska. Wa Kee, like Goon Dip, was
      a successful labor contractor who supplied Chinese workers to the railroad
      companies and other industries in Portland and other parts of Oregon in
      the 1860s and 1870s. <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/69/rec/1">C.
      K. Ah Fong</a> became a prominent doctor who practiced his trade for over
      twenty years in Idaho starting in 1889. Chinese immigrants were also very
      successful truck gardeners. They supplied fresh vegetables to mining and
      other communities in the Columbia River Basin.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">As the Chinese population in the Pacific Northwest increased, so did hostile
      responses from many prejudiced whites in the region. <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1234/rec/1">Anti-Chinese
      sentiments</a> frequently became enshrined in legislation that denied the
      Chinese equal treatment under the law and limited their economic opportunities.
      The Oregon Territorial Legislature, during the1856-57 session, passed a
      bill to tax all Chinese miners two dollars a month. In 1866, the Idaho Territorial
      Legislature passed a similar law that assessed &#8220;All Mongolians, whether
      male or female&#8221; a foreign miner&#8217;s tax of five dollars a month.

    <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Chinese immigrants frequently became targets of violence.
        Many whites resented the Chinese because of perceived competition in mining
        and other work, and because they did not understand their culture. In
        Idaho in the 1870s and 1880s, for example, whites raided opium dens, destroyed
        shacks, and assaulted and robbed many Chinese. Other Chinese were murdered.
        In February 1879, the massacre at Loon Creek near the Yankee Fork of the
        Salmon River claimed the lives of fifteen &#8220;celestials.&#8221; In
        Washington, riots in Tacoma and Olympia during the mid-1880s resulted
        in the banishment of the Chinese from both communities. In March 1886,
        an anti-Chinese mob ordered Chinese residents to leave Portland; however,
        swift response by City leaders and police protected the Chinese and prevented
        the mob from carrying out their threats. Chinese immigrants in other areas
        were not as fortunate. For example, in 1887 in Hell&#8217;s Canyon of
        the Snake River, whites robbed and massacred thirty-one Chinese miners.</p>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Chinese immigrants, like African Americans in the era of Jim Crow laws,
        often found it difficult to receive equal treatment in the courts. Perpetrators
        of violence against the Chinese usually escaped prosecution and punishment,
        and Chinese immigrants were denied the right to testify in court against
        whites. In addition, Chinese immigrants tried in the courts could not
        expect a fair trial. On rare occasions, a handful of elected officials
        and justices favored Chinese involved in civil or criminal cases. These
        officials, however, incurred the wrath of the white community and were
        removed from office. White hostility against the Chinese gained intensity
        in the 1870s and peaked with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act
        of 1882, which essentially ended further immigration from China.</p></td>

      Chinese immigrants are rather unique compared to other immigrant groups
      in American history. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and subsequent national
      laws, effectively <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1174/rec/1">curtailed
      further immigration from China</a> and insured that the Chinese community
      in the United States remained a &#8220;bachelor&#8221; community until WW
      II, when restrictions were eased. Discrimination and anti-Chinese laws deprived
      Chinese men of a family life, since few Chinese women could immigrate to
      the U.S. and miscegenation laws prevented them from marrying white women.
     <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Discrimination and exclusion laws fostered the development
      of protective associations that substituted for family life for Chinese
      men. Early in Chinese history, family clan associations formed to protect
      and support all related members. Although association membership was restricted
      to related members, in the United States membership was expanded to include
      all persons with the same surname. Clan associations supported the social
      welfare needs of their members and mediated disputes. District companies,
      like family clans, also served as protective associations for their American
      members. Originally formed during the sixteenth century by merchants in
      the Cantonese region of China, district associations limited membership
      to persons from the same geographical district. District organizations emerged
      early in the history of Chinese immigration in the United States, since
      most Chinese immigrants prior to 1965 came from the Cantonese region. </td>

      protective district associations, which became known as the six Chinese
      companies. The companies served as mutual aid societies and provided a variety
      of services to their <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1179/rec/1">members</a>.
      They provided temporary housing, loans, labor placement, and protection
      to new arrivals, and served as intermediaries with government authorities.
      The companies also paid the travel costs of immigrants who signed contracts
      before departing China that obligated them to repay the companies from earnings
      after their arrival in the United States. District companies became the
      dominant social institution in Chinese immigrant communities, since most
      Chinese men were single or had left their families in China.

  <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">The six Chinese companies, although they served as protective associations
      for Chinese immigrants, limited the freedom of their members, who had to
      remain loyal to their company. They could not seek work independently and
      were required to abide by their company&#8217;s policies, especially in
      disputes with other Chinese companies. The companies held members accountable
      for their behavior and punished offenders. This tight control generated
      internal conflict and fostered resistance to their influence in the Chinese
      American community. In Idaho in 1872 a feud developed between the Sze Yap
      and Yoeng Wah companies. In addition, secret societies that became known
      as tongs emerged to challenge the power of the six companies. Tongs were
      based on fraternal principles that accorded the same treatment to their
      members regardless of clan affiliation or social class background. Tongs
      challenged the business monopoly of the six companies in gambling, opium,
      and other activities. However, conflict between tong associations also developed.
      In Portland, for example, four tong associations signed a <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1260/rec/2">peace
 agreement</a> in April 26, 1917, in which they agreed to resolve conflicts
      peacefully, and recognized the Mayor, the District Attorney, and the Commissioner
      of Immigration as mediators.

Repeal
        of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943 ushered in a new trend of Chinese
        acceptance. The Walter-McCarran Act of 1952 and the Immigration Quota
        Act of 1965 further eased restrictions on Chinese immigration. Thousands
        of Chinese, mostly from Hong Kong, immigrated to the United States after
        1965. This new wave of immigration finally began to mitigate the unbalanced
        sex ratio of Chinese men to women in the United States and began a transformation
        of Chinese American communities. </p>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">Since 1965, Chinese American communities have undergone tremendous change.
        Chinatowns have seen a social transformation, as second-generation Chinese
        Americans attained higher levels of education and well-paying jobs and
        moved to the suburbs. However, decline of Chinatowns prompted revitalization
        efforts, as occurred in Portland during the early 1960s. Chinese American
        social activists, influenced by the social movements of the 1960s, focused
        their efforts on the social needs of the immigrant elders who remained
        in Chinatown neighborhoods. The communities remained places where second-
        and third-generation Chinese Americans &#8220;can go home&#8221; and practice
        their cultural traditions and foodways.</p>

        and cultural life. They contributed much needed labor and services in
        developing the region. Despite widespread discrimination, Chinese immigrants
        persevered in urban communities, and these communities grew with a new
        wave of immigration in the period after 1965. </p>
