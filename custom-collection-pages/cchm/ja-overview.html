            Oregon Short Line and other railroads in the Columbia River Basin. By
            1907, the Japanese comprised about 40 percent of Oregon&#8217;s total
            railroad labor force. These workers commanded higher wages from railroad
            companies as the sugar beet industry began competing for their labor.</p></td>

          land to lease to gain more autonomy over their labor. For example, Toji
          Fujimoto came to Idaho in the early 1900s to work as a beet laborer for
          the Utah and Idaho Sugar Company. He saved his wages to rent 180 acres to

            entered domestic service for a Portland family. He later became a labor

          the West Coast to ten inland concentration camps located in isolated areas
          in seven states. Those removed were first incarcerated in &#8220;Assembly
          Centers,&#8221; including the Portland livestock pavilion. The Minidoka
          camp, located north of Twin Falls near Hunt, opened in August 1942 and housed
          10,000 Issei and Nisei internees, mostly from western Washington and Oregon.
          Yakima Valley Japanese Americans were interned at Heart Mountain, Wyoming,
          and Hood River Japanese were sent to Tule Lake in northern California. Japanese
          Americans living in Idaho, eastern Oregon, and in Washington east of the
          Columbia River escaped incarceration. Some 256 Issei from all parts of the
          West and even Peru were interned at the Immigration and Naturalization Service
          (INS) facility near Kooskia, Idaho. The Japanese internees helped construct
          the major highway that links Lewiston, Idaho, to Lolo, Montana.</td>

          Nisei demonstrated their courage by joining the service. The famous 442nd

          war&#8217;s most decorated unit.</td>

          Act allowed Japanese immigrants to become naturalized citizens of the United
          States. In the 1970s, Japanese Americans and their supporters began a decades-long
          redress movement that ultimately pressured Congress and the President to
          formally apologize and provide monetary compensation to the surviving internees
          in 1988. The road to redress also helped heal the rifts within the Japanese
          American community, between those who resisted the draft, to protest the
          government's civil rights violations, and those who tried to silence this

            Japanese American cultural traditions. Buddhists from southwest Idaho
            and southeastern Oregon established a temple in Ontario in 1947 and built
            a new one in 1957. The Oregon Nikkei Endowment dedicated a memorial garden
            and historical plaza in Portland&#8217;s Tom McCall Waterfront Park in
            1990. In 1991, the Snake River chapter of the JACL raised funds to launch
            a $10 million cultural center in Ontario to honor those relocated or interned.
            Scholars and activists initiated the Densho (meaning to leave a legacy)
            Project in Seattle in 1996 to create oral histories with Japanese Americans
            who were incarcerated and to provide digital documentary resources to
            educate the public and promote democratic principles. The Sansei, or third-generation
            Japanese Americans, played an important role in commemorating the history
            of the Issei and Nisei experience and in reviving Japanese cultural arts.
            Taiko drumming groups, for example, first formed in the mid-1970s, became
            even more popular in the 1990s, attracting non-Japanese Americans as well
            as Sansei.</p>
