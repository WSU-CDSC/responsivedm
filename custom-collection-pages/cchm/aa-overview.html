    <h2 style="padding-bottom: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; margin: 12px;"><strong><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</strong></p></h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">As a member of the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1805-1806, William 
                  Clark&#8217;s servant York was one of the first African Americans 
                  to set foot in the Pacific Northwest. African Americans have continued 
                  to come to the region ever since. Before the mid-nineteenth century, 
                  they came as fur trappers, pioneers, 
                  and homesteaders. After 1860 they came in search of homesteads and 
                  work opportunities in mining and with the railroad companies. They 
                  were enterprising single men, women, and families who persisted 
                  in the face of numerous social obstacles to form the communities 
                  that today dot the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.

                  Americans encountered prejudice that often inhibited their efforts 
                  to establish roots. This intolerance, at times blatant but often 
                  subtle, provided a powerful impulse for blacks to build their own 
                  community institutions, such as churches, fraternal and political 
                  organizations, and mutual aid societies. Discrimination often shaped 
                  their residential patterns, their occupational choices, and limited 
                  their opportunities for social advancement. White racial bias against 
                  blacks varied depending on the history of particular communities 
                  and the size of the black population in a given community. The defining 
                  feature of African American communities in the region, however, 
                  was their persistence in creating their own institutions in the 
                  face of many obstacles. African Americans sought to establish and 
                  maintain friendly relations with whites, and many whites cast aside 
                  social and racial markers to help blacks build their institutions. 
                  Today the numerous vibrant black communities throughout the Columbia 
                  River Basin bear witness to the historical persistence and resiliency 
                  of African Americans. </p>

                  Opportunities for economic advancement attracted African Americans 
                  to Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Trapper John Hinds came to Idaho 
                  to help establish the Waiilatpu mission. He died in 1836. George 
                  Bush, a free black from Philadelphia, settled in the Oregon territory 
                  north of the Columbia River in the mid 1840s in an area known as 
                  Bush Prairie where he became a successful farmer. The discovery 
                  of gold and silver in Idaho in the early 1860s attracted adventurous 
                  pioneers such as George Washington Blackman, who became a successful 
                  miner in the Hailey area. Blackman Peak in the Sawtooth National 
                  Recreation area bears his name. 
                  George Winslow came to Yamhill, Oregon from California with trapper 
                  Ewing Young in 1834. Francis, who was from New Jersey, became a 
                  successful businessman in Portland in the 1850s and was one of the 
                  wealthiest African Americans in Oregon, and perhaps in the Pacific 
                  Northwest. He ran a boarding house in 1852, and the 1860 census 
                  recorded that he owned real estate valued at $16,000 and personal 
                  property valued at $20,000. </p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">African Americans began to settle in Spokane in the 1870s. The 
                  1880 census listed six blacks in Spokane County, and recorded Oregon, 
                  eastern Canada, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio as their 
                  place of origin. Rudolph Scott migrated to the Pacific 
                  Northwest around 1880 and settled in Spokane in 1883. Leading a 
                  prominent life in local affairs, he founded an insurance company, 
                  was a member of the Republican Party, and served as Vice President 
                  of the John Logan Colored Republican Club. </p>

                single men, but families began to settle in the region by the late 
                19th century. <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/1038/rec/1">Eugene 
                Settle</a> recalls in an oral history interview that he migrated with 
                his parents and siblings from Oklahoma to Moscow, Idaho, in 1898, 
                because his father wanted to homestead. <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/1075/rec/7">Clara 
                Terrell&#8217;s</a> grandfather homesteaded in Salt Lake City, as 
                part of Hiram Walker&#8217;s Mormon group. Her parents met there and 
                married. Her father moved his family to Idaho because &#8220;as a 
                young fellow, he heard of cows here in Boise.&#8221; They lived in 
                Idaho Falls before settling on a farm in Rigby. In Oregon, Reuben 
                Shipley and Mary Jane Holmes, of Benton County, were prominent farmers. 
                Former slaves Shipley and Holmes married in 1857 and purchased 101 
                acres. Finding success as farmers they purchased additional acreage 
                in 1865 and 1866.</p>

                  in southern, eastern and some mid-western states motivated African 
                  Americans to migrate to the Columbia River Basin. Many believed 
                  that the racial atmosphere in the Pacific Northwest was much more 
                  tolerant, although the history of the region renders that perception 
                  questionable. Obstacles imposed by racial prejudice and racist practices 
                  provided a powerful impulse for African Americans to build their 
                  own community institutions.</p>
              <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/23/rec/1"><img alt="St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, Boise, Idaho 1981" src="/customizations/collection/cchm/pages/img/stpaulchurch.jpg" width="218" height="225" border="0"></a>
             <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;"> African American pioneers immediately began 
                to organize their own churches. In Portland, several black artisans 
                and unskilled laborers founded one of the first black churches in 
                1862, a small multi-denominational congregation called the &#8220;People&#8217;s 
                Church.&#8221; In Spokane the Calvary Baptist Church was organized 
                in 1890, with the Rev. Peter B. Barrows listed as one of its founders. 
                That same year the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal was also organized, 
                with the Rev. A.C. Augustus as one of its founders. In Pocatello, 
                Idaho the first African American churches, the Colored Baptist Church 
                and African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), were founded in 1908. 
                Rev. Walter Dranon was the first pastor of the Methodist Episcopal 
                Church, and the Rev. Charles B. Clements became the first pastor of 
                the Colored Baptist Church. In the 1920s Boise black churches included 
                St. Paul Baptist and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal. </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">As the first institutions in emerging African American 
                  communities in the Columbia River Basin, African American churches 
                  served as fulcrums of leadership formation and social activism and 
                  worked to protect the community&#8217;s social welfare. Churches 
                  often helped catalyze black community fraternal and civic organizations, 
                  for it was in church-sponsored activities that black leaders emerged. 
                  For example, in Spokane the first generation of African American 
                  community leaders sprang from the Calvary Baptist and Bethel African 
                  Methodist Episcopal churches. In 1890 the Spokane chapter of the 
                  Afro American League formed within six months of the founding of 
                  the two churches. E.H. Holmes, a member of Bethel African Methodist 
                  Episcopal Church, became the founding Vice President of the Spokane 
                  chapter of the Afro American League. Rev. Peter Barrows, of the 
                  Calvary Baptist Church, with others established the John A. Logan 
                  Club, a political organization.

                <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">In Oregon race relations between African Americans and whites hardened 
                  during the political organization of the Oregon Territory in the 
                  late 1840s. Members of the Territorial Legislature introduced laws 
                  that attempted to exclude blacks from the benefits of full citizenship 
                  rights. These efforts were unsuccessful. However, anti-black attitudes 
                  surfaced again during the Constitutional Convention of 1857. In 
                  this session anti-black delegates managed to secure passage of ballot 
                  measures that prohibited further immigration of blacks and mulattoes 
                  to Oregon, although efforts to make Oregon a slave state failed. 
                  The voters approved overwhelmingly measures that both outlawed slavery 
                  and prohibited blacks and mulattoes from residing in Oregon. Laws 
                  that discriminated against African Americans remained in place through 
                  the late 19th and early 20th centuries, despite passage of the Fourteenth 
                  and Fifteenth amendments to the U. S. Constitution. This, however, 
                  did not daunt black leaders and organizations in their struggle 
                  to end discrimination in housing, employment, education and public 
                  accommodations.</p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 12px; color: #262a2d; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, san-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 12px;">African Americans experienced racial discrimination 
                in employment and in public accommodations such as restaurants, hotels 
                and other public places. In Spokane in the 1890s blacks arriving by 
                train as recruits to work for the Great Northern Railroad were met 
                by white workers who kept them from disembarking. Some blacks challenged 
                discriminatory treatment. In 1919 S.S. Moore sued the Pantages Theater, 
                a vaudeville and movie house in Spokane, after he was forced to sit 
                in the balcony. The jury awarded Moore $200 in damages, arguing that 
                &#8220;even&#8221; black men had the right to sit anywhere they chose. 
                In Boise in the decades before World War II blacks were not served 
                at the Bus Depot restaurant. Discrimination against blacks continued 
                after the war in Boise and <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/1043/rec/1">elsewhere</a>. 
                African Americans in Pocatello in the early 1950s were not served 
                in some local <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/imls_3/id/435/rec/1">hotels 
                or restaurants</a>. When the famous group The Ink Spots performed 
                at the Moore Inn, the bartender refused to serve them. Yet Pocatello 
                and Spokane did not segregate blacks in the public schools. </p>

                housing. In Portland during World War II, a housing shortage developed 
                under the pressure of the dramatic influx of migrants attracted by 
                the labor demands of the defense industry. Over 20,000 black migrants 
                arrived there to take advantage of job opportunities and competed 
                with white workers for available housing. Throughout this period local 
                newspapers regularly reported the resistance of local business and 
                political leaders to providing equal housing opportunities for blacks. 
                As a result, most blacks were forced to live in the Albina district 
                of North Portland and at Vanport, a hastily erected housing complex 
                built by the Kaiser shipbuilding company to house its burgeoning <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1008/rec/1">workforce</a>. 
                Newspaper accounts also recorded the persistent efforts of black leaders 
                and social activists, and their white supporters, to accomplish housing 
                desegregation. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s successfully 
                broke down much of the city's resistance to <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1053/rec/1">black 
                residential integration</a>.
          In some cases individual employers and landlords resisted 
                integration, but in other instances, discrimination flowed from labor 
                organizations or public institutions. The Portland Housing Authority 
                maintained a recalcitrant posture throughout the 1940s and beyond 
                that effectively segregated the few black families that successfully 
                navigated the application process and got an apartment. The Housing 
                Authority of Portland Board of Directors consistently refused to to 
                apply for federal funds in order to construct affordable public housing 
                for African Americans. <a href="http://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/collection/wsuvan1/id/1056/rec/2"><img alt="Resolution against the Housing Authority of Portland by the Citizen's League for Equal Opportunity, September 20 1963" src="/customizations/collection/cchm/pages/img/reshacl.jpg" width="240" height="266" border="0"></a></p>

                of Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders, and Helpers, Local 72, also discriminated 
                against blacks. The union systematically denied membership or full 
                membership rights to black workers in the defense industries in Portland 
                during World War II. Local 72, and its avowed racist leader, subordinated 
                black defense workers by keeping them out of the best paying jobs, 
                or by preventing them from securing defense industry positions. Black 
                activists and defense workers waged a long struggle to break 
                down the barriers to job advancement for African American workers. 
                They succeeded eventually, but victory came at a high emotional, psychological, 
                and material cost for black defense workers.</p>

            communities. Improvements in employment, housing, and social acceptance 
            reflect the legacy of the historical 
            resiliency of African Americans and their struggle for civil rights.</p>
